Make VT&amp;R Great Again


*VTR2 Install Notes*

Most instructions for VTR2 installation can be found here: https://github.com/utiasASRL/vtr2
These are mainly aimed at older laptops with Ubuntu 14.04. Some changes for 16.04 installation are mentioned.
Additional (older) notes can be found on the lab wiki: http://192.168.42.2/mediawiki/index.php/ROS:Charlottetown_Installation

TODO (Ben): add notes on 16.04 install on Lenovo P53 (with NVIDIA T2000 gpu)
