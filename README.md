## What is VT&amp;R3?

VT&amp;R3 is a C++ implementation of the Teach and Repeat navigation framework. It enables a robot to be taught a network of traversable paths and then accurately repeat any network portion. VT&amp;R3 is designed for easy adaptation to various sensor (camera/LiDAR/RaDAR/GPS) and robot combinations. The current implementation includes a feature-based visual odometry and localization pipeline that estimates the robot's motion from stereo camera images and a point-cloud-based odometry and localization pipeline for LiDAR sensors.

## Install VT&amp;R3

### Hardware & Software Requirement

A high-powered, Nvidia GPU-enabled machine with [Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/). See below for VT&amp;R3 dependencies and how to install them.

<!-- At ASRL, we run VT&amp;R3 on Lenovo P53 laptop that has an Intel Core i7-9750H CPU, 32GB DDR4 RAM and an NVIDIA Quadro T2000 4GB GPU. -->
<!-- - (INTERNAL) Note: for dual boot system, remember to DISABLE [device encryption](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4028713/windows-10-turn-on-device-encryption) before start installing Ubuntu. -->

### Create VT&amp;R3 Directories

The following environment variables are assumed present so that files and data can be put into different locations on different machines. It is recommended to put them in `.bashrc`.

```bash
export VTRROOT=~/ASRL  # (INTERNAL default) root directory of VTR3 (this variable only initializes the following variables and will not be used anywhere else)
# you can change the following directories to anywhere appropriate
export VTRSRC=${VTRROOT}/vtr3        # source code of VTR3 (this repo)
export VTRDEPS=${VTRROOT}/workspace  # system dependencies of VTR3
export VTRVENV=${VTRROOT}/venv       # python dependencies of VTR3 (not used at the moment)
export VTRDATA=${VTRROOT}/data       # datasets for VTR3
export VTRTEMP=${VTRROOT}/temp       # temporary data directory for testing
```

Remember to create these directories

```bash
mkdir -p ${VTRSRC} ${VTRDEPS} ${VTRVENV} ${VTRDATA} ${VTRTEMP}
```

If the default values above are used, the final directory structure should look like

```text
|- ~/ASRL
  |- data              datasets for VTR3
  |- temp              temporary files
  |- venv              python virtual env for VTR3 (NOTE: currently not used, but will do eventually)
  |- vtr3              VTR3 source code and installation
    |- drivers           sensor, controller drivers not specific to VTR3
    |- extra             VTR3 specific sensor, robot, dataset specific add-ons
    |- launch            tmuxp launch files
    |- main              main packages of VTR3, must be installed to get a working system
    |- robots            robot description packages not specific to VTR3
  |- workspace         system dependencies source code and (maybe) installation
    |- opencv            opencv source code cloned from github, installed to /usr/local/[lib,bin]
    |- opencv_contrib    extra opencv source code cloned from github, installed together with opencv
    |- proj              the latest version of PROJ, installed to /usr/local/[lib,bin]
    |- vtr_ros2_deps     VTR3 dependencies from public repositories without modification
```

### Download VT&amp;R3 source code

Download the source code from GitHub

```
cd ${VTRSRC}
git clone git@github.com:utiasASRL/vtr3.git .
git submodule update --init --remote
```

Machine specific settings

- Change [Nvidia GPU compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) in [gpusurf](./main/src/deps/gpusurf/gpusurf/CMakeLists.txt) line 16 based on your GPU model (default to 7.5).
- Change `OpenCV_DIR` in [gpusurf](./main/src/deps/gpusurf/gpusurf/CMakeLists.txt) line 21 and [vtr_common](./main/src/vtr_common/vtr_include.cmake) line 48 to point to your OpenCV+CUDA installation (default to `/usr/local/opencv4.5.0/lib/cmake/opencv4`). If you do not have an OpenCV+CUDA installation, keep the default value for now, continue to the next section and we will eventually install OpenCV to this location [here](#install-opencv-450).

### Install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (>=11.3)

We recommend install CUDA from Debian packages following instructions [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). Be sure to perform [post-installation actions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index). Do not forget to put the following line in `.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-<your cuda version, e.g. 11.3>/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
```

You can check the CUDA driver version using `nvidia-smi` and CUDA toolkit version using `nvcc --version`.

### Install [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (>=3.3.7)

```bash
# Debian package
sudo apt -y install libeigen3-dev

# OR from source if preferred
mkdir -p ${VTRDEPS}/eigen && cd $_
git clone https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen.git . && git checkout 3.3.7
mkdir build && cd $_
cmake .. && make install # default install location is /usr/local/
```

### Install [PROJ](https://proj.org/) (>=8.0.0)

The instruction below is mostly copied from [this page](https://proj.org/install.html#compilation-and-installation-from-source-code), except that the source code is cloned from GitHub.

Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install cmake libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libtiff-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Download PROJ from GitHub to the following directory: `${VTRDEPS}` and check out the branch of the version you want to install

```bash
mkdir -p ${VTRDEPS}/proj && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ.git .
git checkout <proj-version>  # e.g. <proj-version> = 8.0.0
```

Build and install PROJ

```bash
mkdir -p ${VTRDEPS}/proj/build && cd $_
cmake ..
sudo cmake --build . --target install  # will install to /usr/local/[lib,bin]
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}  # put this in bashrc
```

### Install [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (>=4.5.0)

Install OpenCV with CUDA from source to a customized location so that it is not conflicted with OpenCV installed from Debian packages. The instruction below is copied from [this page](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html) with install location changed to `/usr/local/opencv4.5.0` to be different from the default `/usr/local`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev python3-dev python3-numpy
```

Download OpenCV and OpenCV Contrib from GitHub to `${VTRDEPS}`

```bash
cd ${VTRDEPS}
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
```

Check out the version you want to install

```bash
cd ${VTRDEPS}/opencv && git checkout <opencv-version>  # e.g. <opencv-version> = 4.5.0
cd ${VTRDEPS}/opencv_contrib && git checkout <opencv-version>  # e.g. <opencv-version> = 4.5.0
```

Build and install OpenCV

```bash
mkdir -p ${VTRDEPS}/opencv/build && cd $_  # create build directory
# generate Makefiles (note that install prefix is customized to: /usr/local/opencv4.5.0)

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opencv4.5.0/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}  # put this in bashrc, note that the path should match CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
```

### Install [ROS2 Foxy](https://www.ros.org/) (and optionally ROS1 Noetic+ros1_bridge)

Follow [this page](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html) to install ROS2 Foxy binary packages or build from source. For Debian package installation, the `test_msgs` package needs to be installed manually

```bash
sudo apt install -y ros-foxy-test-msgs  # given that ROS2 Foxy is also installed from Debian packages
```

If you are working with robots or sensors that are ROS1 but not ROS2 enabled, also install ROS1 Noetic following instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation) (install binary packages or build from source). [ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/tree/foxy) is required to pass messages between ROS1 and ROS2, which can be [built from source](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/tree/foxy) or installed from Debian packages

```bash
sudo apt install -y ros-foxy-ros1-bridge  # given that ROS2 Foxy is also installed from Debian packages
```

### Install miscellaneous system libraries

```bash
sudo apt install -y tmux  # for launching VTR3
sudo apt install -y doxygen  # for building the documentation
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm protobuf-compiler  # for building the VTR web-based graphical user interface
sudo apt install -y libboost-all-dev libomp-dev  # boost and openmp, needed by multiple packages
sudo apt install -y libpcl-dev  # point cloud library, for LiDAR VTR

```

### Build and install miscellaneous ROS2 dependencies

```bash
mkdir -p ${VTRDEPS}/vtr_ros2_deps/src
# xacro (for robot descriptions)
cd ${VTRDEPS}/vtr_ros2_deps/src
git clone https://github.com/ros/xacro.git ros2_xacro
cd ros2_xacro
git checkout 2.0.3
# vision opencv (for camera T&R)
cd ${VTRDEPS}/vtr_ros2_deps/src

cd ros2_perception_pcl
git checkout 2.2.0
# install all
cd ${VTRDEPS}/vtr_ros2_deps
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash  # source ros2 workspace first, e.g. for Debian package install
colcon build --symlink-install
source ${VTRDEPS}/vtr_ros2_deps/install/setup.bash  # source the overlayed workspace
```

### Build and install driver and robot description packages

Driver and robot description packages are not required, depending on the sensors and robots to be used with VT&amp;R3. However, you will need to install some of them to run VT&amp;R3 offline with the datasets we provide.

- (INTERNAL) Note: ASRL students install them all.

Source the ROS2 workspace with VT&amp;R3 installed

```bash
source ${VTRDEPS}/vtr_ros2_deps/install/setup.bash
```

Install drivers

```bash
cd ${VTRSRC}/drivers/ros2
colcon build --symlink-install
source ${VTRSRC}/drivers/ros2/install/setup.bash
```

Install robot descriptions

```bash
cd ${VTRSRC}/robots/ros2
colcon build --symlink-install
source ${VTRSRC}/robots/ros2/install/setup.bash
```

### Build and install VT&amp;R3

Source the ROS2 workspace with all dependencies installed

```bash
source ${VTRSRC}/robots/ros2/install/setup.bash
```

Install VT&amp;R3 ROS2 packages

- option 1 (for users)

  ```bash
  cd ${VTRSRC}/main
  colcon build --symlink-install
  ```

- option 2 (for maintainers)

  ```bash
  cd ${VTRSRC}/main
  colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="--coverage"  # Debug build with code coverage test
  colcon test --event-handlers console_cohesion+ # Will also run style check for c++, python, cmake and xml files.
  colcon test-result  # Summary: xx tests, 0 errors, 0 failures, 0 skipped
  lcov --capture --directory build/ --output-file vtr3_coverage_report.info
  genhtml vtr3_coverage_report.info --output-directory vtr3_coverage_report
  ```

  Open the html report at `vtr3_coverage_report/index.html` to see code coverage. Note that this option is for development only and not intended to be used for end-to-end online/offline experiments (such as the video demos below).

  State estimation in VT&R (odometry, mapping and localization) can be built to run deterministically by adding the following flags to the [common cmake file](./main/src/vtr_common/vtr_include.cmake), given that data arrive at a sufficiently slow rate.

  ```bash
  add_definitions(-DVTR_DETERMINISTIC)  # disable multi-threading in VTR state estimation and force any GPU job to run deterministically
  add_definitions(-DSTEAM_DEFAULT_NUM_OPENMP_THREADS=1)  # disable multi-threading in STEAM
  ```

Build VT&amp;R3 user interface

```bash
VTRUI=${VTRSRC}/main/src/vtr_ui/vtr_ui/frontend/vtr-ui
npm --prefix ${VTRUI} install ${VTRUI}
npm --prefix ${VTRUI} run build
```

### Build and install VT&amp;R3 add-ons

These packages are not required, but you need to install them to run VT&amp;R3 offline with the datasets we provide.

- (INTERNAL) Note: ASRL students should at least install vtr_bumblebee_xb3 to use the Bumblebee XB3 camera on Grizzly.

Source the ROS2 workspace with VT&amp;R3 plus drivers and robot packages installed

```bash
source ${VTRSRC}/main/install/setup.bash
```

Install add-ons

```bash
cd ${VTRSRC}/extra
colcon build --symlink-install
source ${VTRSRC}/extra/install/setup.bash
```

## VT&amp;R3 Datasets

Some datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mPgBBOGbbJ6zS2oaua_9PlK7r7nP_N1I?usp=sharing). Unzip and store them into `${VTRDATA}`, e.g.,

```text
|- ${VTRDATA}
  |- utias_20210412_camera_vtr_storage
  |- utias_20210812_lidar_rosbag
```

These datasets are collected at UTIAS campus using a Clearpath Grizzly vehicle equipped with a Waymo Honeycomb LiDAR and a Bumblebee XB3 stereo camera.

## Launch VT&amp;R3

We use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and [tmuxp](https://github.com/tmux-python/tmuxp) to launch and run VT&amp;R3. They are useful tools that allow multiple terminal sessions to be launched and accessed simultaneously in a single window.

### Offline Mode

With the datasets above, VT&amp;R3 can be run without connecting to any sensor or robot.

#### Stereo SURF-Feature-Based T&R

Prerequisites

- Installed VT&amp;R3+UI inside `main` folder including all its dependencies.
- Installed Grizzly robot description packages inside `robots` folder.
- Installed `pgr_triclops` package inside `drivers/ros2` folder and `vtr_bumblebee_xb3` package inside `extra` folder.
- Downloaded the `utias_20210412_camera_vtr_storage` dataset into `${VTRDATA}`.

The video demo [at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12OkMyHeFCCE6MkJDMRz89GfIJI7xFtJA/view?usp=sharing) shows how to

- Launch VT&amp;R3 to use stereo camera images as input.
  ```bash
  tmuxp load ${VTRSRC}/launch/offline_vtr_camera.launch.yaml
  ```
- Use the UI to start teaching a path.
  ```bash
  # replay the first image sequence
  source ${VTRSRC}/extra/install/setup.bash
  # ros2 run vtr_bumblebee_xb3 BumblebeeReplay <dataset directory>                          <topic>   <manual scrub> <start> <end> <replay rate> <sequence>
  ros2 run vtr_bumblebee_xb3 BumblebeeReplay   ${VTRDATA}/utias_20210412_camera_vtr_storage front_xb3 false          900     3500  1             0
  ```
- Use the UI to perform loop closure, i.e., merge into existing path.
- Use the UI to align the graph with the underlying satellite map.
- Use the UI to place the robot on a different location in the graph.
- Use the UI to specify a repeat path and start repeating the path.
  ```bash
  # replay the second image sequence
  source ${VTRSRC}/extra/install/setup.bash
  # ros2 run vtr_bumblebee_xb3 BumblebeeReplay <dataset directory>                          <topic>   <manual scrub> <start> <end> <replay rate> <sequence>
  ros2 run vtr_bumblebee_xb3 BumblebeeReplay   ${VTRDATA}/utias_20210412_camera_vtr_storage front_xb3 false          900     3500  1             1
  ```
- Terminate VT&amp;R3 (`Ctrl-C` once in terminal)

#### LiDAR Point-Cloud-Based T&R

Prerequisites

- Installed VT&amp;R3+UI inside `main` folder including all its dependencies
- Installed Grizzly robot description packages inside `robots` folder
- Downloaded the `utias_20210812_lidar_rosbag` dataset into `${VTRDATA}`.

The video demo [at this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xbPbynoPbpjamt2RJ0-OfQGhCUmqRqE/view?usp=sharing) shows how to

- Launch VT&amp;R3 to use LiDAR point-clouds as input
  ```bash
  # launch command
  tmuxp load ${VTRSRC}/launch/offline_vtr_lidar.launch.yaml
  ```
- Use the UI to start teaching a path and replay point-clouds from the dataset
  ```bash
  # replay the first rosbag
  source ${VTRSRC}/main/install/setup.bash
  ros2 bag play ${VTRDATA}/utias_20210812_lidar_rosbag/rosbag2_2021_08_12-20_02_12
  ```
- Use the UI to perform loop closure, i.e., merge into existing path.
- Use the UI to align the graph with the underlying satellite map.
- Use the UI to place the robot on a different location in the graph.
- Use the UI to specify a repeat path and start repeating the path.
  ```bash
  # replay the second rosbag
  source ${VTRSRC}/main/install/setup.bash
  ros2 bag play ${VTRDATA}/utias_20210812_lidar_rosbag/rosbag2_2021_08_12-20_14_20
  ```
- Terminate VT&amp;R3 (`Ctrl-C` once in terminal)

### (INTERNAL) Online Mode - VT&amp;R3 on Grizzly

#### Grizzly Connection and Control

Perform the following steps to start driving Grizzly manually. Steps marked with "\*" should be done with help from a lab mate during first attempt.

- \*Turn on Grizzly and [configure Grizzly network](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cEl4yywMoPAmXSkztuviJ0WbO6gnxGhJlt47_H44oBc/edit?usp=sharing).
- \*Connect Grizzly computer (via the ethernet cable) and XBox controller (via usb) to your laptop.
- Use [grizzly_control.launch.yaml](./launch/grizzly_control.launch.yaml) to start a tmux session that passes commands from the XBox controller to Grizzly, by opening a new terminal and inputing the following command. \*You will be asked to input Grizzly computer's password at the bottom pane. Ask a lab mate for password and controller key mappings.
  ```bash
  tmuxp load ${VTRSRC}/launch/grizzly_control.launch.yaml
  ```

You should now be able to drive Grizzly manually (when emergency stop is released). Always keep the tmux session (launched by [grizzly_control.launch.yaml](./launch/grizzly_control.launch.yaml)) on while running (Stereo/LiDAR) VT&R3.

How it works: your machine receives commands from the XBox controller and publishes them as ROS2 messages. The Grizzly computer receives ROS2 messages and converts them to ROS1 messages, which are then received by the internal micro-controller.

#### Stereo SURF-Feature-Based T&R

Connect the Bumblebee XB3 camera (via usb-c) to your machine. (You may be asked to authenticate this connection.) Use [online_vtr_camera.launch.yaml](./launch/online_vtr_camera.launch.yaml) to launch VT&amp;R3 and wait for a few seconds. The web UI should start automatically, and you should see left&right images received from the camera.

```bash
tmuxp load ${VTRSRC}/launch/online_vtr_camera.launch.yaml
```

You should now be able to use VT&R3 same as in offline mode with datasets.

#### LiDAR Point-Cloud-Based T&R

Connect the Honeycomb LiDAR (ethernet-usb) to your machine. Use `honeycomb.launch.yaml` to turn on the sensor, which will then publish point-clouds as ROS1 and ROS2 messages (ros1_bridge is launched alongside).

```bash
tmuxp load ${VTRSRC}/launch/honeycomb.launch.yaml
```

Use `online_vtr_lidar.launch.yaml` to launch VT&amp;R3. The web UI should start automatically.

```bash
tmuxp load ${VTRSRC}/launch/online_vtr_lidar.launch.yaml
```

You should now be able to use VT&R3 same as in offline mode with dataset.
