## Build Tools

VTR2 uses [Polymer 1.0](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/about_10) to build its entire frontend. However, [Polymer 3.0](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/feature-overview) is out now with lots of syntax changes. The process of creating the frontend templates have also changed. Given these changes, we suggest to rewrite the entire frontend using more recent web-development tools, such as [LitElment](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/).
